### Is It Safe to Plan a 2021 Road Trip in the US amidst Lingering Pandemic Conditions?**

As of April 2, 2021, the CDC clearly states:
“People who are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized vaccine can travel safely within the United States.”

So as of this update – the US has given a green light for vaccinated Americans to safely go on a road trip! Of course, they still advise taking some additional precautions like wearing masks on public transport and monitoring for symptoms after traveling.

For those who cannot get vaccinated, the CDC further offers advice on how to travel domestically as safely as possible, recommending testing and/or quarantining measures. Read the official CDC domestic travel guidance here.
